  # Define a source and destination table to transfer data
  #
  # ==== Options
  #
  # * <tt>:to</tt> - (Required) Class of the destination table
  # * <tt>:limit</tt> - Set a limit to the number of rows to transfer.
  #   This is useful when you're trying to find faulty data in the source
  #   table, and don't want to run the entire dataset.
  # * <tt>:validate</tt> - Default = true. Use ActiveRecord validations
  #   when saving the destination rows.
  # * <tt>:source_type</tt> - Default = :active_record. Sets the source
  #   destination type.
  #   Options:
  #   _:active\_record_: Assumes the From option is a class that inherits
  #   from ActiveRecord::Base, then iterates through each record of From
  #   table by using *From*.all.each...
  #   _:other_: Assumes the From option is an iterable 'collection' whose 
  #   elements/items can respond to all source methods speficied in the given block.
  # * <tt>:store_as</tt> - Stores the generated destination record as a key
  #   that is retrievable in other transformations. Note that for this to work, the 
  #   source object must respond to the method <tt>id</tt> which returns
  #   a value that is unique for all rows within the table (usually 
  #   this is just a primary key).
  #
  #   _Example_
  #   <tt>
  #   transfer_from Mammal, :to => Species, :store_as => 'new_animal' do
  #     match_same_name_attributes
  #   end
  #
  #   transfer_from Person, :to => Animal do
  #     stored 'new_animal', :to => :species
  #   end
  #   </tt>
  #

                                        :source_type => args.extract_options![:source_type] || :active_record,
                                        :type => 'transfer'

    end
    @status_report
  end

  # Define a source and destination table with which to update data
  #
  # This method accepts all of the same options as <tt>transfer_from</tt>.
  #
  # In addition, you'll need to use a series of columns that match data
  # from the source to the destination. For example, if your source  and 
  # destination data have a social security number, then you'd use the
  # social security number to match records from the two rows. The following
  # is how you would do that.
  #
  # <tt>
  # update_from SourceTable, :to => DestinationTable do 
  #   based_on do
  #     ssn == from.social_security_number
  #   end
  #
  #   from :last_name, :to => :last_name
  # end
  # </tt>
  #
  # Note that when using the 'based_on' method, the left-hannd item always
  # corresponds to a column method on the destination table.
  # 
  # The methods available in the based_on block correspond to the well-known
  # squirrel plugin's syntax. Here's a quick review of the possible operators:
  #
  # Handles comparisons in the query. This class is analagous to the columns in the database.
  # When comparing the Condition to a value, the operators are used as follows:
  # * ==, === : Straight-up Equals. Can also be used as the "IN" operator if the operand is an Array.
  # Additionally, when the oprand is +nil+, the comparison is correctly generates as "IS NULL"."
  # * =~ : The LIKE and REGEXP operators. If the operand is a String, it will generate a LIKE
  # comparison. If it is a Regexp, the REGEXP operator will be used. NOTE: MySQL regular expressions
  # are NOT the same as Ruby regular expressions. Also NOTE: No wildcards are inserted into the LIKE
  # comparison, so you may add them where you wish.
  # * <=> : Performs a BETWEEN comparison, as long as the operand responds to both #first and #last,
  # which both Ranges and Arrays do.
  # * > : A simple greater-than comparison.
  # * >= : Greater-than or equal-to.
  # * < : A simple less-than comparison.
  # * <= : Less-than or equal-to.
  # * contains? : Like =~, except automatically surrounds the operand in %s, which =~ does not do.
  # * nil? : Works exactly like "column == nil", but in a nicer syntax, which is what Squirrel is all about.
